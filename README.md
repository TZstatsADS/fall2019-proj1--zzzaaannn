### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Are there any differences of lyrics between 20th and 21st century?
+ This project is conducted by Zian Zhou

+ Project summary: 
We are now in the end of second decade of 21st century. Thanks to advances in every sectors such as technology and transportation, people are living more convenient, efficient and colorful. Back to 20th century, it was hard to imagine that over 95% Americans would own a cell phone in future. Surprisingly, cell phones with keyboards fade and out, and almost everyone is using a large screen cell phone. Not only time and technology are changing rapidly, but also habits can change.

Would lyrics be different between 20th century and 21st century? Do 21st-century singers still write the similar lyrics as the past?

To answer these questions, my goal is to
1. analyze the evolution of lyrics by its length
2. compare the frequent stemmed words between centuries and examine stemmed words for genres
3. deeper analyze topics of genres in different centuries using topic modeling
